# ABS · AI Business System

ABS is an operating system for running a business the lean way: a curated knowledge base of tool cards,
terms, forms, courses and rules, plus planning and diagnosis built on it. This skill lets you use it from here.
Answers come from the ABS knowledge base, not from general knowledge — that is the point of calling it.

ABS is an independent product, not affiliated with, sponsored or endorsed by Danaher.
ABS 为独立产品，与丹纳赫无隶属、赞助或背书关系。

All commands run the bundled script: `python3 scripts/abs.py <command> …` (path relative to this skill's folder;
Python 3.8+, no packages needed). Add `--json` to any command for the raw response.

## First use: connect with the user's access token

1. Run `python3 scripts/abs.py whoami`.
2. If it says there is no token (or the token was rejected), ask the user:
   “Please create an access token in ABS → **Personal Settings → Access tokens**, copy it, and paste it here.”
   中文：「请在 ABS 的**个人设置 → 访问令牌**里生成一个令牌，复制后发给我。」
3. Run `python3 scripts/abs.py login <token>`. It checks the token and saves it in the user's config file
   (readable only by the user). **Never repeat the token back in the conversation.**

The site address is already set to the ABS site this skill was downloaded from. Only for a private deployment
pass `--base-url https://…` to `login`.

## When to use it

| The user wants to… | Command |
|---|---|
| Know how a method or tool works, what the rules or formulas are, where to start | `search`, then `card <id>` for the full tool card |

`search` returns a short snippet around the match — enough to choose what to open, not the full text. Open the
card (or the source page) for the real content. The first 100 searches a day are free; beyond that each one costs
1 credit, so search with intent instead of sweeping the library.
| Check where a number or rule comes from | `card <id>` (sources, rule basis, pages), then `page <pdf> <n>` for the original page |
| Get an answer grounded in ABS materials, with sources | `ask "<question>"` |
| Study: which course fits, what a lesson covers, practise a lesson | `courses`, `course <id>` |
| Plan something: a kaizen week, a training program, a transformation, hiring a key role … | `plan "<what they want to achieve>"` |
| Assess a situation: production records, a report, a shop-floor photo, a described problem | `diagnose "<question>" [--file PATH]` |

Do **not** use it for unrelated tasks (general coding, travel, chit-chat) or when the user asks for your own
opinion without ABS. More examples: `references/tasks.md`.

## Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/abs.py whoami
python3 scripts/abs.py search "SMED 换型时间怎么压" --limit 8
python3 scripts/abs.py card smed
python3 scripts/abs.py page DBS教材34_DBS系统导入.pdf 102
python3 scripts/abs.py ask "How do I set the takt time for a new cell?"
python3 scripts/abs.py courses
python3 scripts/abs.py course tutorial-22-smed
python3 scripts/abs.py plan "下周开一场改善周，提升 L1 线的一次合格率" --start 2026-10-12
python3 scripts/abs.py plan-get DRF-20261012-0001
python3 scripts/abs.py plan-list
python3 scripts/abs.py diagnose "Why do we keep missing daily output?" --file line1-hourly.xlsx
```

Language follows the text you pass (Chinese in → Chinese out; English in → English out). Override with
`--lang zh|en`, e.g. when the user writes in English about a Chinese document.

## How to answer

- Build the answer on what ABS returned. Keep its citations (`[1]`, `[Source 1]`, `[来源1]`) and list the sources
  with their links at the end. If ABS has nothing relevant, say so instead of filling in from memory.
- **Label what you use.** ABS tags rules and sources with their basis, and so should you:
  - 教材口径 / textbook — stated in the source course material (a page can be fetched to check it);
  - 行业标准 / industry standard — not in the textbook, or taken from a non-Danaher source;
  - ABS 设计决策 / ABS design decision — ABS's own judgement, not the textbook's;
  - 待客户校准 / to be calibrated — the method is given but the number must be set per customer;
  - 非丹纳赫外部件 / non-Danaher external source — material from another company.
  Anything ABS did not return is your own knowledge: mark it as yours, never cite ABS for it.
- **To verify a number or rule**, read `card <id>`: the card text and the rule notes explain corrections (for
  example why a total of 36 in the source is a typo), and the card lists its sources and the pages you can fetch;
  then `page <pdf> <n>` saves that one original page as an image. Single pages only, about 40 per minute.
- `plan` returns a plan built from the ABS knowledge base, in Markdown (phases, steps, schedule, forms, sources)
  with a link. Its **Coverage and gaps** section says what ABS covered, what the knowledge base has but this plan
  leaves out (it can be planned from ABS separately), what is **not in the knowledge base** (plan those separately
  and say they are not from ABS) and which parts are defaults (e.g. a default number of weeks). A **Date checks**
  section lists milestones that were moved because they fell before today or on a public holiday, and a **Review**
  section lists what the server-side review changed (week themes only) and what a person should check.
  Keep those statements in your answer. The plan is saved as a **draft**: tell the user to review it in ABS and submit
  there — submitting is what creates projects and tasks. Show the key parts rather than pasting everything.
- `diagnose` sends the question and the file to ABS and its AI model. Ask before sending anything confidential.
  Add `--save` to keep it in the user's diagnosis records.
- Errors: `401` → the token is invalid, revoked or expired: ask the user for a new one and `login` again.
  `403` → the account's role cannot do this (read-only accounts cannot plan). `429` → too many calls; wait and retry.
  `402` → the account is out of ABS credits for this step: tell the user, do not retry in a loop.
  `503` → the ABS AI model is temporarily unavailable; `search`, `card` and `courses` still work.

## Privacy

The token acts as the user: same permissions, same visibility, same expiry as their ABS account, and it only
works on the ABS agent API. The user can revoke it at any time in Personal Settings → Access tokens.
